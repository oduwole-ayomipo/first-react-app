## My process

### Built with

- React
- React Components
- JSX syntax
- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

My knowledge in DOM manipulation in Javascript heightened. I also learnt how to think critically when it comes to writing javaScript programs; from the problem definition, to writing Pseudo codes, then finally coding the actual solution.
